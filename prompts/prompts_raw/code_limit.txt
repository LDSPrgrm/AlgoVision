Note that the frame width and height are 16.0 and 9.0 respectively. And the center of the frame is (0, 0, 0).
It means to avoid putting any object out of the frame, you should limit the x and y coordinates of the objects.
limit x to be within -8.0 and 8.0 for objects, and limit y to be within -4.5 and 4.5 for objects.
Place the objects near the center of the frame, without overlapping with each other.
